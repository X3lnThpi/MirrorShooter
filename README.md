- The game uses the Command pattern to implement character movement mechanics.
- Walking, running, and jumping are separate command classes.
- The Singleton pattern is used for shooting mechanics, with a single instance of the shooting class shared by all players.
- The State pattern is used for rocket propulsion mechanics.
- Separate state classes for different flight modes such as ascending, descending, and boosting.
- Power-up mechanics are designed using the Strategy pattern.
- Separate strategy classes for each type of power-up, such as fuel, ammo, and health.
- Design patterns provide a structured approach to designing different mechanics in the game.
- Patterns allow for more flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.
- The code is organized and maintainable with the implementation of these patterns.
